SSH Beam is a simple Android app with which you can "Share" things to an SSH server,
via the SFTP protocol (you know, the one used by `scp`).

  * Find something to share
  * Click **Share**
  * Select **SSH BEAM**
  * Enter the required info (server, user name,...)
  * Click **Send**
  * Wait until done

At the moment, I'm only checking if the file exists on the server (in which
case I don't overwrite), but that's it. Use at your own risk.

# Use cases

I just built this to scratch an itch, but you can use it for a whole lot of things :

  * Setup a cron job that publishes posts from a specific directory on your
    server, and then publish posts with SSH Beam from your Android device.
  * Send torrents to a directory watched by [rTorrent](http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/)
  * ...and much more!

# Building

Use the latest SBT-Android snapshot (0.7-SNAPSHOT from [my
branch](https://github.com/fxthomas/android-plugin/tree/rewrite-cleanup) at the
moment), and run `apk` to package the app.
